Find yourself tired in the middle of a boring lecture? Are you starting to lose track of the topic as your mundane teacher keeps yapping on? 
Meet stayWake, a website with enhanced A.I. speech recognition that converts your professor’s boring speech into readable notes and produces high quality multiple-choice questions that allow you to test your knowledge. Get a question right and receive progress points. A leaderboard shows your status in comparison to that of your classmates, making lectures a whole lot more competitive. Get a question wrong and the A.I. produces an explanation of the correct answer in comparison to what you did, allowing you to understand your mistake.
This interactive website allows you to see a leaderboard with the top 3 scores of students across the class and your position respective to them. Make a boring lecture fun, competitive, and productive by contending for the leaderboard podium. The podium can be used by your professor to award extra credit, candy, or any prize your teacher deems respectable. Regardless of getting the spotlight, you’ll study better with stayWake because lectures are a lot less boring so you won’t miss out on essential learning.
Turn your classes into a ranked multiplayer game, study for tests better, and count on the AI to prepare you for all topics with this fun and helpful website.
### Inspiration
We’ve all had to hear a professor drone on about an interesting topic, causing to fall asleep. We made this so that students’ grades don’t suffer.
### How we built it
We used Streamlit for data analysis and Figma for web design. Using pre-trained libraries like gpt4 and whisperAI, we sped up the transcription and generation process so our app could be a success.
### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the short timeframe, we were able to create an application we're immensely proud of. Not to mention, it has great future potential provided more time to develop.
### Future features
Teachers will be able to record their lectures and stayWake will generate questions in real-time, which will be displayed on all students' screens and will disappear in one minute.
### What we learned
This project helped us understood how crucial it is to take breaks and rest. Whenever we took a break and then regrouped 10 minutes later, we were able to see the bugs in our code a lot more clearly.
